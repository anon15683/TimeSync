def compress_events(data):
    """
    Compresses a series of lesson events by combining consecutive lessons with the same attributes.

    This function takes a dictionary of lesson data and compresses it by merging
    consecutive lessons that have the same subject, class, teacher, and room,
    and where the end time of one lesson is the start time of the next.

    Args:
        data (dict): A dictionary containing a 'lessons' key, which holds a list
                     of lesson dictionaries. Each lesson dictionary should have
                     'SubjectName', 'StudentClassName', 'TeacherName', 'RoomName',
                     'start', and 'end' keys.

    Returns:
        list: A list of compressed lesson dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list
              represents either a single lesson or a merged series of consecutive
              lessons with the same attributes.
